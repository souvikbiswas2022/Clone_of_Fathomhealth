      <h4>1. A move towards pricing transparency üîç</h4>
      <p>
        There have been public calls for more pricing transparency in healthcare
        for decades, but limited public interest in an issue that few felt (or
        could even attribute) acutely. The explosion of high-deductible plans
        has turned those disparate sparks into a flame.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the executive order issued in June explicitly aiming to force
        providers and plans to operate with greater transparency, many RCM
        operations will scramble to set up the infrastructure necessary to
        support transparency. Given that few have the technology, operations, or
        infrastructure in place to offer transparency, it will take time, but
        there is finally momentum.
      </p>

      <h4>2. Widespread automation ü§ñ</h4>
      <p>
        If there was a healthcare executive at the JP Morgan conference who
        didn‚Äôt speak about automation, I must have missed it. 2019 saw
        automation technologies prove themselves across a number of functions,
        particularly on the administrative side, providing organizations with
        the case studies and evidence needed to push through new initiatives.
      </p>

      <h4>3. Heightened focus on security üîê</h4>
      <p>
        As evidenced by the media fervor over Ascension's partnership with
        Google, consumers are becoming increasingly concerned about the privacy
        and security of their personal data. This increased awareness is coming
        amidst a broad movement of data towards the cloud and many, if not all,
        revenue cycle functions to outside service providers. Providers will
        mitigate risk by demanding higher standards of security and compliance
        from all their vendors. Good news for audit and certification firms.
      </p>

      <h4>4. Ambient AI-driven transcription doesn‚Äôt pan out üíª</h4>
      <p>
        2019 saw a number of startups such as Robin, Notable, and Suki hoping to
        take the technology that had made Alexa and Siri household names and use
        it to finally free physicians from documentation--an AI scribe that
        would passive listen to an encounter and create notes. Unfortunately,
        the bar for accuracy combined with the technical challenge of distilling
        a conversation (rather than direct dictation) to accurate and concise
        clinical notes is far beyond current technology. Expect to see these
        startups narrow their focus to something that looks a lot like Nuance‚Äôs
        current offerings or shift their focus to other parts of the patient
        journey or physician experience.
      </p>

      <h4>5. More provider-payer collaboration üí∏</h4>
      <p>
        As frustration with the increasing inefficiency of the traditional
        revenue cycle process has grown and value-based payment initiatives
        begin to demonstrate positive returns, expect to see both sides continue
        to find new and creative ways to align interests to reduce costs and
        increase predictability and transparency for both sides.
      </p>

      <h4>6. Clean, well-structured data üß±</h4>
      <p>
        As both vendors and providers continue to see their efforts to adopt new
        technologies get blocked or hamstrung by issues of data access, format,
        and fragmentation, look for large investments in data unification
        efforts that will allow organizations to more easily adopt or build
        in-house solutions.
      </p>

      <h4>7. Growth in outpatient CDI üìÅ</h4>
      <p>
        The AHA has reported that outpatient revenue is now roughly equivalent
        (95%) to inpatient revenue for American hospitals[1]. Naturally, with
        the increased revenue comes increased revenue risk. Thorough and
        accurate documentation in the outpatient setting will play a more
        meaningful role in revenue integrity than ever. As coding automation
        rates increase due to technologies like ours, look for RCM operations to
        increasingly deploy their coders to outpatient CDI efforts alongside the
        adoption of tools like Iodine and Artifact Health.
      </p>

      <h4>8. VC ü§ù RCM</h4>
      <p>
        One of the PE community‚Äôs favorite hunting grounds is about to be
        overrun by Stanford grads in Patagonia vests. Over the last couple of
        years, we have seen a remarkable number of companies coming through
        YCombinator or being funded by tier-one venture funds that are focused
        on addressing various pieces of the revenue cycle. While not all of
        these firms have found strong product-market fit, they have educated the
        venture capital community on both the scale of the revenue cycle
        industry and the opportunities for technology to transform it.
      </p>

      <h4>
        9. Providers accelerate their efforts to outsource their revenue cycle
        üö™
      </h4>
      <p>
        R1 is projecting a 12% annual growth in outsourced RCM through 2022.
        That number may turn out to be conservative as automation technology and
        offshore labor pools drive substantive cost and efficiency benefits to
        scaled RCM operations.
      </p>

      <h4>10. Better measurement and analytics üìä</h4>
      <p>
        With better infrastructure, data, and tooling, RCM operations will be
        empowered to measure and track all the things they have always been
        wanting to and a handful they probably haven‚Äôt yet imagined that they
        could.
